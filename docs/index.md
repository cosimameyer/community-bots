## What This Project is About

This project focuses on building community-driven bots for Bluesky and Mastodon to support and grow the Python, R, and data community. The bots help by 

- Boosting posts tagged with #pyladies or #rladies, 
- Sharing portraits of amazing women in tech, 
- Posting useful resources by PyLadies and R-Ladies, and 
- Celebrating community achievements. 

With these bots, I hope to give others an automated megaphone to increase visibility for underrepresented groups in the tech space.

Designed to increase engagement and visibility, the bots run automatically open-source tools. The project also provides a detailed, open guide for others interested in setting up similar bots. At its core, itâ€™s about using automation to strengthen and connect our communities.

This projects marries multiple components:

- Sharing content by [**PyLadies**](https://github.com/cosimameyer/awesome-pyladies-blogs) and [**R-Ladies**](https://github.com/rladies/awesome-rladies-blogs)
- [**Sharing Amazing Women in Tech**](https://gallery.cosimameyer.com/amazing-women-in-tech/)

## Where can I find the bots?

You can find the bots on Bluesky (and formerly also on Mastodon). I'd love to extend it to other platforms - so if you have ideas, let me know!

### Mastodon

    ðŸ‘‹ Those bots are currently looking for a new home (i.e., an instance at Mastodon). If you know of something, please feel free to reach out!
